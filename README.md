# -Calculation-of-parasitic-delay-and-transistor-width-ratio

-> Designed the inverter with equal rise time and fall time in NGSpice for a specific fanout of 4.

-> Observed the effect of different fanout on inverter delays by varrying the fanout from 1 to 8.

-> Calculated the ratio of width, minimum delay and parasitic delay for the inverter.
